LibreWolf for Win64
-------------------

This repository is still a work in progress.

But we have a zip file and an installer available for testing right now..

**Downloads**: To get the installer, the zipped version, and the sha256sum checksums, head over to the [releases](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/releases) page.

Note: If your version of LibreWolf does _not_ run, an additional install of the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632) might be required.

Please consult the file **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** above, to see if your issue is already reported.
