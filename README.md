LibreWolf for Win64
-------------------

This repository is still a work in progress.

But we have a zip file and an installer available for testing right now..

**Downloads**: To get the installer, the zipped version, and the sha256sum checksums, head over to the **[releases](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/releases)** page.

Note: If your version of LibreWolf does _not_ run, an additional install of the [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) component for 'Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019' might be required.

Please consult the file **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** above, to see if your issue is already reported.
