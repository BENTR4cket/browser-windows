LibreWolf for Win64
-------------------

We have a zip file and an installer available now.. We're no longer consider this alpha quality, but it surely is not aout of beta. The main issue people encounter is that non-default themes don't work correctly.

This repository is for the windows installer, this repo is not for _librewolf.cfg_ issues, that goes [here](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings). These config file settings are system-wide for all users.

**Downloads**: To get the installer, the zipped version, and the sha256sum checksums, head over to the **[releases](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/releases)** page.

Note: If your version of LibreWolf does _not_ run, an additional install of the [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe) component might be required.

Please consult the file _KNOWN_ISSUES.md_ above, to see if your issue is already reported.
