# LibreWolf for windows

## [ticket #142](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/142) - Compilation machine failed on: Wed 29 Dec 2021 01:35:38 PM CET, and is reduced to sand. So we can't create new builds right now.

* **[download latest release](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/releases)**
* Visit [the FAQ](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/).
* Install via _[chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/librewolf)_: `choco install librewolf`
* or install via _winget_: `winget install librewolf`
* **If your LibreWolf crashes on startup**, you probably miss the right [Visual C++ Runtime](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0). You want the _Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019_ version for **x64**, which would be **[this file](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)**.
* The .zip files are _'portable zip files'_ that allows for a user profile in the extracted zip file folders. It is _self-contained_.
