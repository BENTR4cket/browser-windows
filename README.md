# LibreWolf for windows

* **[download latest release](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/releases)**
* Visit [the FAQ](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/).
* Install via _[chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/librewolf)_: `choco install librewolf`
* or install via _winget_: `winget install librewolf`
* **If your LibreWolf crashes on startup**, you probably miss the right [Visual C++ Runtime](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0). You want the _Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019_ version for **x64**, which would be **[this file](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)**.
* The .zip files are _'portable zip files'_ that allows for a user profile in the extracted zip file folders. It is _self-contained_.

# Compiling the windows version

This segment is for people who want to build LibreWolf for themselves. The build of the LibreWolf source tarball is in public CI, so you can use that. Given that you have followed the steps in the Mozilla setup guide:

* [Building Firefox On Windows](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html)

Once that works, you can check out and compile LibreWolf like this:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows.git
cd windows
make fetch build
```

Currently a bug in `./mach package` makes this build fail, but it did produce the distribution .zip file that we're after. So after this, you can just:

```
make artifacts
```
This will produce the -setup.exe and portable .zip. Have fun!
