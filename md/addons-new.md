## uBlock Origin tweaks

[uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) comes bundled with LibreWolf. Also see their [wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki). We'll mention a few filter lists and entry points to the uBlock wiki.

Some essential uBlock Wiki pages to understand how uBlock Origin works:

* Easy mode, the default mode that we ship with the browser -> [Blocking mode:easy-mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-easy-mode).
* Dynamic filtering, suggested for enhanced protection -> [Dynamic filtering:quick guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide).
* Medium mode, suggested for enhanced protection, might require to fix some websites manually -> [Blocking mode:medium-mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode).


**Filter lists:**
