Known Issues (2021-02-07)
-------------------------

These issues are already reported, and sorted by priority:

* Help > About LibreWolf: It is broken and is unreadable. ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* Automation builds. This seems to be a possibility mentioned [here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html#building-firefox-on-windows). ([issue #6](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/6))
* Is there any way to update? ([issue #12](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/12))
* Previous session tabs, doesn't restoring after restart, although option is enabled in settings. ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* There some issue with rendering. All looks a bit blurred, or if there no smoothing enabled. ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* Choosing a bookmark inside an empty tab loads the page in the same tab, else, if the tab is not empty, it loads in a new tab. Right-clicking on the bookmark, and selecting "Open" (which is bold) from the context menu correctly opens the link in the same tab. Essentially, unless the tab is empty, left-clicking on a link behaves as if middle-mouse-clicking on a link. ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* Middle-mouse-button scrolling does not work? Is this intentional, and if yes, is there a setting to re-enable it again? ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* When I tweaked some settings according to privacytools.io and I tried coveryourtracks it gave 17 bits of data, while a vanilla hardened Firefox gave 14 bits in same Configuration. This is very concerning as librewolf is supposed to perform better than FF. ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* _Theme Aspenglow_ and the minimize/maximize/close buttons don't work correctly. ([issue #11](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/11))
* GPO (Group Policy Objects) support. ([issue #3](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/3))
